        <h2>Chef John's American Goulash</h2>

        <p>
         American goulash was one of my all-time favorite
         comfort food meals when I was growing up. They
         served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice
         of buttered white bread and a carton of milk.</p>

         <p>
         This Americanized version of goulash was invented 
         to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food
         for a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that
         doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your
         weeknight dinner rotation.
